# Basic Example

Without custom config, mdd works best with the following folder structure:

- doc
    - example
        - basic.md
    - usage
        - getting-started.md
- README.md

The `README.md` file will be used as index page, the other markdown files will all get there own page and item in the sidebar.

## Start mdd

```bash
mdd
```

## Open your browser

Open your favorite browser and surf to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and enjoy your documentation.
